    Handlers for \int, \frac, _ and ^ have been implemented.  A complete
    set of greek character translations exists.  Nested blocks are
    handled correctly now.  latex2unicode passes fairly complex tests
    and bests BrightMare in some circumstances.

    latex2unicode passes very simple tests.  Nevertheless, the
    infra-structure has been set up and expansion should be rapid (if
    not trivial :).  latex2unicode sports a very limited set of
    character translations (see L2U/Constants.pm).
