0.5
    latex2unicode has been modularized and code exposure doesn't cause
    ill health any longer.
0.4
    latex2unicode handles all the test cases of BrightMare well.
--->  Current version
0.3
    The last major handler, \sqrt, has been implemented.
0.2
    Handlers for \int, \frac, _ and ^ have been implemented.  A complete
    set of greek character translations exists.  Nested blocks are
    handled correctly now.  latex2unicode passes fairly complex tests
    and bests BrightMare in some circumstances.
0.1
    latex2unicode passes very simple tests.  Nevertheless, the
    infra-structure has been set up and expansion should be rapid (if
    not trivial :).  latex2unicode sports a very limited set of
    character translations (see L2U/Constants.pm).
